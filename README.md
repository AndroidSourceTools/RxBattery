Usage
-----

In the **Kotlin** application, you can use library as follows:

```kotlin
RxBattery
  .observe(context)
  .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
  .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
  .subscribe { textView.text = it.toString() }
  }
```

In the **Java** application, you can use library as follows:

```java
RxBatteryFactory
  .observe(context)
  .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
  .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
  .subscribe(batteryState -> {
    textView.setText(batteryState.toString());
  });
```

`BatteryState` looks as follows:

```kotlin
data class BatteryState(
  val status: Int,
  val plugged: Int,
  val health: Int
  val level: Int,
  val temperature: Int,
  val voltage: Int,
)
```

All `Integer` values returned by `BatteryState` object are reflected in constants of [`BatteryManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager) class from the Android SDK.
For `status` search constants with `BATTERY_STATUS_` prefix, for `plugged` - `BATTERY_PLUGGED_`, for `health` - `BATTERY_HEALTH_`, `level` represents values from 0 to 100%, `voltage` and `temperature` are quite descriptive names.

Examples
--------

Exemplary Kotlin application is located in `app-kotlin` directory.

Exemplary Java application is located in `app-java` directory of this repository.

Download
--------

TBD.

Tests
-----

Tests are available in `library/src/test/kotlin/` directory and can be executed on JVM without any emulator or Android device from Android Studio or CLI with the following command:

```
./gradlew test
```

To generate test coverage report, run the following command:

```
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```

Code style
----------

Code style used in the project is called `SquareAndroid` from Java Code Styles repository by Square available at: https://github.com/square/java-code-styles.

Static code analysis
--------------------

Static code analysis runs Checkstyle, FindBugs, PMD, Lint, KtLint and Detekt. It can be executed with command:

```
./gradlew check
```

Reports from analysis are generated in library/build/reports/ directory.
